Between- and within-site ICC's are plotted with the calibrated ICC's in Figure \ref{fig:calib}. All between-site ICC's improved with the exception of the lateral ventricle, which did not change after calibration. The within-site ICC's of the thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala decreased slightly after calibration. Both calibrated and uncalibrated within-site ICC's were greater than 90\% for the MS related ROIs listed in this paper. For the full set of within- and between- site ICC's of the Freesurfer regions, see the Supplemental Materials.
