Scan-rescan reliability for the 20 scanners is shown in tables \ref{tab:acquisition1} and \ref{tab:acquisition2}. The majority of scan-rescan reliabilities were greater than 80\% for the selected Freesurfer-derived volumes, which included gray matter volume (GMV), cortical white matter volume (cWMV), cortex volume (cVol), lateral ventricle (LV), thalamus (thal), amygdala (amyg), caudate (caud), hippocampus (hipp), and estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV). However, the thalamus at sites 19 and 20 had low scan-rescan reproducibility, below 70\%. %The quality control process only discarded scans that had miss-classified cortical gray matter segmentation, but did not check misclassified subcortical regions due to time restrictions.
