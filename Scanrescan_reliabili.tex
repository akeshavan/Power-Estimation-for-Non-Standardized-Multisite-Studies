Scan-rescan reliability for the 19 scanners is shown in tables \ref{tab:acquisition1} and \ref{tab:acquisition2}. The majority of scan-rescan volumes were greater than 80\%. However, the thalamus at sites 19 and 20 had low scan-rescan reproducibility, below 70\%. %The quality control process only discarded scans that had miss-classified cortical gray matter segmentation, but did not check misclassified subcortical regions due to time restrictions.
