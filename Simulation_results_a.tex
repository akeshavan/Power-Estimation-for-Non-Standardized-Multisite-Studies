Simulation results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:powersim}. The simulated and theoretical curves align closely when power is equal to 80\%, but the simulated curve is slightly lower than the theoretical curve for power below 80\%. This is probably due to the uncertainty in our scaling factor estimates.
