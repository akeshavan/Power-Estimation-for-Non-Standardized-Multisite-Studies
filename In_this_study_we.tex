In this study, we investigate a number of well-defined brain volumetrics related to multiple sclerosis disease progression. Even though focal white matter lesions seen on MRI largely characterize multiple sclerosis (MS), lesion volumes are not strongly correlated with clinical disability \cite{lesions1,lesions2,lesions3}. Instead, gray matter atrophy measurements, such as thalamus \cite{thal1,thal2,thal3,thal4} and caudate \cite{caud1,caud2} volumes, appear to be better predictors of disability \cite{gm1,gm2,gm3,gm4}, along with cortical white matter volumes \cite{white1}  %The sites included in this study are part of the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC), which aims to integrate clinical, genomic, and imaging data to understand the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis.
