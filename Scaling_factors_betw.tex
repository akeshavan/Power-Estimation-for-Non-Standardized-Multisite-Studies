Scaling factors between sites were estimated using ordinary least squares from the average of the scan-rescan volumes, referenced to average scan-rescan volumes from the UCSF site. The OLS was run with the intercept fixed at 0. $CV_a$ for each metric was calculated from the sampling distribution of scaling factor estimates $\hat{a}$ as follows: %from the standard deviation of the scaling coefficient estimates, $\hat{\beta_i}$ for site $i$, divided by the mean.
