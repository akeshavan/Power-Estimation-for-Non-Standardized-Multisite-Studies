Test-retest reliability, defined as ICC(1,1) \cite{fmriReliability}, was computed across each site and protocol for the selected metrics using the "psych" package in R. The between-site ICC(2,1) values were computed following the procedure from previous studies on multisite reliability \cite{fmriReliability,cannon2014}. Variance components were calculated for a fully crossed random effects model for subject, site, and run using the "lme4" package in R. Using the variance components, between site ICC was defined as
