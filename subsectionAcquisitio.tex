\subsection{Acquisition}
T1-weighted images were acquired from 12 subjects (3 Male, 9 Female, ages 24-57) in 20 scanners across Europe and the United States. These scanners varied in make and model, including all three major manufacturers: Siemens, GE, Phillips. Two scans were acquired from each subject with repositioning. Previously, Jovicich and colleagues showed that reproducible head positioning along the $z$ axis significantly reduced image intensity variability across sessions \cite{freesurferReliability}. By repositioning in our study, a realistic measure of test-retest variability due to the repositioning consistency of each site's scanning procedure was captured. Tables \ref{tab:acquisition1} and \ref{tab:acquisition2} show the acquisition parameters for all 20 scanners.
