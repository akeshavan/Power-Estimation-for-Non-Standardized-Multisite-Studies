Finally, to address the concern about whether these scaling factors could apply to a disease population, we calculated scaling factors from 12 healthy controls and 14 MS patients between 2 scanners at UCSF. The patients had a mean age of 51 years with standard deviation of 11 years, mean disease duration of 15 years with a standard deviation of 12 years, and mean Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 2.8 with a standard deviation of 2.2. Because MS patients have lesions that could affect Freesurfer's tissue classification, all images were manually corrected for lesions and were edited following Freesurfer's quality assurance procedure. Images that were still missclassified after thorough edits were removed from the analysis, because calibration factors need to be calculated from accurate segmentations.
