    \caption{Comparing the within-site ICC before and after leave-one-out scaling factor calibration with the cross-sectional freesurfer results of \cite{jovicich2013brain}, where scanners were standardized, and the average within-site ICC is shown. The within-site ICCs of our study fall within the range of \cite{jovicich2013brain}, which shows the that sites in this study are as reliable as those in \cite{jovicich2013brain}.}
