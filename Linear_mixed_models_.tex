Linear mixed models are common in modeling data from multisite studies because metrics derived from scanner, protocol, and population heterogeneity may not have uncorrelated error terms when modeled in a GLM, which violates a key assumption \cite{garson2013fundamentals}. Since are only interested in the effect of scanner-related heterogeneity, we assume that populations are the same at each site. This causes error terms to cluster by scanner and sequence type due to variation in field strengths, acquisition parameters, scanner makes, head coil configurations, and field inhomogeneities, to name a few \cite{cannon2014}. Linear mixed models, which include random effects and hierarchical effects, adjust observation-level estimates based on their clustering characteristics\cite{garson2013fundamentals}.
