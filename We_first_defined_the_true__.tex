We first defined the true, unobserved model for subject $i$ at site $j$ as:

\begin{equation}
U_{ij} = \beta_{00} + \beta_{10}X_{i,j} + \beta_{20}Z_{i,j} + \epsilon_{i,j}
\end{equation}

Where $U_{i,j}$ is the unobserved value of the regional brain volume of interest (without any effects from the scanner), and $\beta_{00}, \beta_{10}$ and $\beta_{20}$ are the true, unobserved, effect sizes. The covariates are $Z_{i,j}$, residuals are $\epsilon_{i,j}$, and the contrast vector, $X_{i,j}$, is given the weights $X_{high}, X_{low} = 0.5,-0.5$ so that $\beta_{10}$ is computed as the average difference between the high and low groups. For this derivation we assume an equal number of subjects observed at each site in the high and low groups with balanced covariates. $\epsilon$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation $\sigma_0$.
