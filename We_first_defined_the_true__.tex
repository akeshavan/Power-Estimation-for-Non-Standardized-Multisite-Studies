We first defined the true, unobserved model at each site $j$:

\begin{equation}
U_{ij} = \beta_{00} + \beta_{10}X_{i,j} + \beta_{20}Z_{i,j} + \epsilon_{i,j}
\end{equation}

Where $U_{i,j}$ is the unobserved value of the regional brain volume of interest (without any effects from the scanner), with covariates, $Z_{i,j}$, residuals, $\epsilon_{i,j}$, and contrast vector, $X_{i,j}$, with values $X_{high}, X_{low} = 0.5,-0.5$. For this derivation we assume an equal number of subjects observed at each site in the high and low groups with balanced covariates. $\epsilon$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation $\sigma_0$.
