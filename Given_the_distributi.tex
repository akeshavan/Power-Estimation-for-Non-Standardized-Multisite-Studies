Where we are assuming that $D_{U,j}$ and $a_j$ are independent, meaning that MRI-related biases are independent of the biological effects being studied. For the derivation of this formula, see the Appendix. Given the distribution of scaling factors and the variance of the true disease effect, $var[D_{U,j}] = 4\sigma_0^2/n$, the equation simplifies to
