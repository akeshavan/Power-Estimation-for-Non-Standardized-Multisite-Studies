Towards this goal, there is a large body of literature addressing the corrections of geometric distortions that result from gradient non-linearities. These corrections fall into two main categories: phantom-based deformation field estimation and direct magnetic field gradient measurement-based deformation estimation, the latter of which requires extra hardware and spherical harmonic information from the manufacturer \cite{fonov2010improved}. Calibration phantoms, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) \cite{gunter2009measurement} and LEGOÂ® phantoms \cite{caramanos2010gradient}, have been used by large multisite studies to correct for these geometric distortions, which also affect regional volume measurements. These studies have outlined various correction methods that significantly improve deformation field similarity between scanners. However, the relationship between the severity of gradient distortion and its effect on regional volumes, in particular, remains unclear. In the case of heterogeneous acquisitions, correction becomes especially difficult due to additional noise sources. Gradient hardware differences across sites are compounded with contrast variation due to sequence parameter changes. Ideally, these phantoms should resemble the humain brain in size, shape, and tissue distribution, in order to properly evaluate the reproducibility of brain segmentation algorithms. Recently, Droby and colleagues have evaluated the stability of a post-mortem brain phantom, and found similar reproducibility of volumetric measurements with a healthy control \cite{droby2015human}. In this study, we propose to measure the amount of bias through direct calibration of regional volumes, by imaging 12 common healthy controls at each site. Quantifying the amount of regional bias allows us to overcome between site variability by optimizing sample size, rather than employing a phantom-based voxel-wise calibration scheme that corrects both contrast differences and geometric distortions.
