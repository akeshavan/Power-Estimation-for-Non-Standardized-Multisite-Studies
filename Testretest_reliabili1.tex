In this study we proposed a statistical model based on on the physics of MRI volumetric biases, which was that biases between sites are scaled. The different scaling factors could account for why a study may estimate different effect sizes based on the pulse sequence used. For example, \cite{streitburger2014impact} found significant effects of RF head coils, pulse sequences, and resolution on VBM results. The estimation of scaling factors in our model depends on good scan-rescan reliability. In our study, scan-rescan reliabilities for each scanner were generally $>0.8$ for Freesurfer derived regional volumes. Cortex volume, cortical gray, subcortical gray, and cortical white matter volumes had greater than 90\% reliability for all 20 sites. The subcortical regions and estimated total intracranial volume had an average reliability of over 89\%, however, some sites had much lower scan-rescan reliability. For example, the thalamus at sites 3 and 16 had test-retest reliabilities between 41 and 63 \%. This could be explained by the visual quality control process of the segmented images, which focused on the cortical gray matter segmentation and the initial standard space registration only, due to time restrictions. Visually evaluating all regional segmentations may be unrealistic for a large multisite study. On the other hand, Jovicich and colleagues \cite{jovicich2013brain} reported a low across session within-site ICC of the thalamus as $.765 \pm .183$, which used the same freesurfer cross-sectional pipeline used in this study. The poor between-site reliability (61\%) of the thalamus is consistent with findings from \cite{schnack2010mapping}, where a multisite VBM analysis showed poor consistency in that region. Other segmentation algorithms may be more robust for subcortical regions in particular.  Cannon and colleagues \cite{cannon2014} report a between site ICC of the thalamus of .95, compared to our calibrated between site ICC of .78, but they used FIRST, which is a different segmentation algorithm. FSL's FIRST algorithm \cite{firstcitation} uses a Bayesian model of shape and intensity features for a more accurate segmentation. Nugent and colleagues reported the reliability of the FIRST algorithm across 3 platforms, and found a good scan-rescan reliability of 83\%, but the between-site ICCs ranged from 57\% to 93\%, based on the subcortical region of interest \cite{firstreliability}. Designing optimized pipelines that are robust for each site, scanner make, and metric, is outside the scope of this paper. However, Kim and colleagues have developed a robust technique for tissue classification of heterogeneously acquired data that incorporates iterative bias field correction, registration, and classification \cite{optimize}. Wang and colleagues developed a method to reduce systematic errors of segmentation algorithms relative to manual segmentations by training a wrapper method that learns spatial patterns of systematic errors \cite{Wang2011}. These methods may be preferred over standard segmentation pipelines when data acquisition is not standardized. The large range of acquisition parameters and size of this dataset will be useful to evaluate such generalized pipelines in the future.
