The scaling factors were also validated by calibrating the regional volumes of each site in a leave-one-out cross validation. The calibrated volume for a particular subject $i$ and site $j$ was scaled by the scaling factor estimated from all subjects excluding subject $i$. Within- and between-site ICC's were calculated for the calibrated volumes. If the scaling factor estimates were inaccurate, the between-site ICC's of calibrated regional volumes would be worse than the between-site ICC's of the original regional volumes.
